This README file contains information on the contents of the cy5976-imx8 layer.

I created this in a graduate school independent study.  The project was to investigate and learn
about hardware security modules generally and then to select an arm board to implement a secure
boot and encrypted root filesystem.  I chose the NXP i.MX8ULP EVK board.  These configurations
are from that project and may help someone trying to implement secure boot or encrypted filesystem
on that device.  This is a proof of concept as I learned the board and underlying technologies.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

Dependencies
============

This depends on the
     meta-imx
     meta-nxp-security-reference-design/meta-secure-boot
layers

I used the basiec instructions found here to get started:
https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/IMX_YOCTO_PROJECT_USERS_GUIDE.pdf

This describes how the necessary layers can be set up using the google repo tool.

Patches

Feel free to submit pull requests if you would like to improve this example.
